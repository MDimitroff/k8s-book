# Pods
**Labels** let you group Pods and associate them with other objects in powerful ways.

**Annotations** let you add experimental features and integrations with 3rd-party tools and services. 

**Probes** let you test the health and status of Pods and the apps they run. This
enables advanced scheduling, updates, and more. 

**Affinity** and anti-affinity rules give
you control over where in a cluster Pods are allowed to run. Termination control lets you gracefully terminate Pods and the applications they run. 
**Security** policies let you enforce security features. 

**Resource requests and limits** let you specify minimum and maximum values for things like CPU, memory, and disk IO.
